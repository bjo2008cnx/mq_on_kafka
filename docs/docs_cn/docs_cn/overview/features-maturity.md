# Features maturity

Feature is stable and ready for production use after we have used it on our production cluster internally and can
assure that there are no major bugs. Some features are already merged and are released but are yet undocumented or
documentation states they are in **incubating** phase. All incubating features have own feature switches which are
off by default.
